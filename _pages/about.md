Jiang Yibo (江一波) has been pursuing a doctoral degree at the School of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University since 2019. He received his Bachelor of Engineering degree from the School of Mechanical Engineering at Dalian University of Technology from 2015 to 2019. His research interests include the tribodynamics of gear transmission systems, uncertainty dynamics, and methods for predicting and controlling mechanical interface performance, i.e., shot peening.
